# Personal Website
**by Francis Nepomuceno**

## About
- The website uses the Django framework in Python as its backend
- A local MySQL database is used as the DB the Django app uses
- Gunicorn and Nginx are used for deploying the project online
- The server itself is hosted as an EC2 instance from Amazon AWS. The OS used
with EC2 is Ubuntu 18.04
- Domains can be purchased from a number of sites. This website uses Google
Domains for its domain

### Using the Virtual Environment
- in the root directory, enter: `source venv/bin/activate`
- to exit out of the virtual environment, enter: `deactivate`

### Setup
- Nginx configuration files (coming soon to the repo) will be needed to set
up the portion of the webserver hosted by Nginx
- Scripts (coming soon to the repo) will show how to set up packages required
by the OS, and how to set up the MySQL database
